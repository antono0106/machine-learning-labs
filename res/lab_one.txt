AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE



When a letter arrives for unhappy but 
ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret 
is revealed to him. His parents were 
wizards, killed by a Dark Lords curse
when Harry was just a baby, and which he 
somehow survived. Escaping from his 
unbearable Muggle guardians to Hogwarts, 
a wizarding school brimming with ghosts 
and enchantments, Harry stumbles into a 
sinister adventure when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third
floor. Then he hears of a missing stone 
with astonishing powers which could be 
valuable, dangerous, or both.
